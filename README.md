A web based desktop environment and system for file storage and sharing.

Its essentially a drop-box / minimal google drive clone designed for widely accesible hardware (php / mysql).

Currently it only has a file viewer, sharing utility and text editor, however development of the full desktop environment will continue as my new project; Pylon https://github.com/SpaceHexagon/pylon
